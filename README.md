### Notes: in Python Venv, you can get no module error for the library "PyInquirer" although you have installed it, unfortunately. However, Works normally when installed "pip3 install PyInquirer", instead of installing on a virtual python environment.

For now, there are **few** questions about **Cryptography, Network and Web Foundations**. I'll add more questions and make it useful for someone who is studying for some infoSec related certificate exams or infoSec job interviews.

# Example Question (out of cryptography_questionsList):

*"Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption - much faster but the key needs to be transferred over an unencrypted channel.*  **(a)True,  (b)False** </br>

*"Asymmetric encryption: uses different keys for encryption and decryption - more secure but slow.*  **(a)True  (b)False**
